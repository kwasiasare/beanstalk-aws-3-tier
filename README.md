Scalable Web Application Architecture on AWS
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a highly scalable, fault-tolerant web application infrastructure on AWS. The architecture leverages best-in-class AWS services to create a robust platform capable of handling variable workloads while maintaining optimal performance and security.

Technical Architecture
The solution features a multi-layered approach that separates user-facing components from backend services:

Content Delivery Layer: Route 53 and CloudFront provide global DNS routing and content caching, ensuring fast response times for users worldwide
Application Layer: Elastic Beanstalk with Apache Tomcat servers in an Auto Scaling Group, automatically adjusting capacity based on demand
Messaging Layer: Amazon MQ enables reliable communication between application components through industry-standard messaging protocols
Data Layer: MySQL on Amazon RDS for persistent storage with Memcached for performance optimization

Key Technical Achievements

Implemented a high-availability design with resources distributed across multiple availability zones
Configured auto-scaling to efficiently handle traffic spikes while minimizing costs during low-demand periods
Established comprehensive monitoring through CloudWatch to enable data-driven optimization
Deployed infrastructure as code using CloudFormation, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments
Implemented security best practices with private subnets for sensitive components and properly configured security groups

Business Impact

This architecture provides the foundation for applications that require enterprise-grade reliability and performance. It enables rapid deployment of new features through CI/CD integration while maintaining operational excellence. The solution is designed to scale from startup to enterprise workloads without architectural redesign.
